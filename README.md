# DONE

- ✅  loading in login
- ✅  animate layout change button
- ✅  optimistic update
- ✅  public/private pages
- ✅  multiple lists per user
- ✅  responsiviness
- ✅  empty state
- ✅  implement [context menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/context-menu) (dont know if its good or nah)
- ✅  figure out why some favicons dont work
- ✅  add a db query to verify if the bookmark already exists and is recent (maybe < 3 months?), so that we dont need to fetch favicon and og image again (now its only urls)
- ✅  address [this](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/api-routes-response-size-limit) problem
- ✅  fix scroll bug in emoji picker and exit when selected
- ✅  add custom favicon and title to different folders
- ✅  add direction button (asc, desc) (API already supports it)
- ❌  preview yt videos (figured out there's no reason to implement this, the user can just click and watch it on yt)
- ❌  add last opened folder (folders are already sorted by last update)


# TODO

- make UI better and create a pattern (paddings, animations, texts) (probably have a menu that contains viewStyle, direction and sign out)
- add search
- add light mode
- allow user to edit and have a custom sort for folders
- maybe insert AI generated og images when one cant be found (too crazy?)
- migrate to jotai (already installed)
- animate direction button
- add option to verify duplicate
