# TODO

- make UI better and create a pattern (paddings, animations, texts) (probably have a menu that contains viewStyle, direction and sign out)
- preview yt videos
- add search
- add tags
- maybe change background, so that dark favicons look better
- allow user to edit and have a custom sort for folders
- maybe insert AI generated og images when one cant be found (too crazy?)
- migrate to jotai (already installed)
- animate direction button
